# BecomeJavaMaster
I'm a Korean highschool student and it has been about 3 months since I learned Java by myself in the weekends.
Now that I went through the basic details, I want to challenge myself and do projects on my own.
The first step will be making my own board games.
I will be covering simple traditional games like Omok first.
Then I will try making chess and Go. I am also thinking of making my own board games.
These codes were all made by myself.. it might be crude but I'm proud of it.
