# BecomeJavaMaster
I'm a Korean highschool student and it has been about 3 months since I learned Java by myself in the weekends. Now that I went through the basic details, I want to challenge myself and do projects on my own. The first step will be making my own board games. I will be covering simple traditional games like Omok first. Then I will try making chess and Go. I am also thinking of making my own board games. These codes were all made by myself.
